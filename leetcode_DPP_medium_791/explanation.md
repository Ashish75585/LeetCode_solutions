# Daily Challenge: Custom Sort String üèÜ

### Level: Medium

## Intution
  To `sort` the input string `s`, in a particular order given in string `order`.

## Given Data:
1. Input string s.
2. string `order`, according to which we have to `sort` the input string `s`

## Solution:
There are total 4 for loops in the code.
Let's break down the purpose of each loop.
1. The first `for` loop is used to convert the `characters` into `map `key` and initialized its value to `0` of string `order`.
2. The second for loop is iterating over the input string s. It's incrementing the value of key that we were created in first for loop.
3. the fourth for loop also iterating over the order.
