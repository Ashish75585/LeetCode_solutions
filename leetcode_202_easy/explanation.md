The Code determines the whether a given number is happy or not.

Explanation of Happy Numbers:
A happy number is a number that eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the square of each digit. If the process of obtaining the sum of squares of digits leads to 1, the number is considered happy. If it results in a cycle of numbers that does not include 1, it is an unhappy number.

### Example of Happy Numeber:
Consider the number 19:

1^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 81 = 82  
8^2 + 2^2 = 64 + 4 = 68  
6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100  
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1  
Since the process ends in 1, 19 is a happy number.

Explanation of Unhappy Numbers:
An unhappy number is a number that does not lead to 1 when replaced by the sum of the square of each digit. Instead, it results in a cycle of numbers that does not include 1.

### Example of Unhappy Number:
Consider the number 25:

2^2 + 5^2 = 4 + 25 = 29  
2^2 + 9^2 = 4 + 81 = 85  
8^2 + 5^2 = 64 + 25 = 89  
8^2 + 9^2 = 64 + 81 = 145  
1^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 1 + 16 + 25 = 42  
4^2 + 2^2 = 16 + 4 = 20  
2^2 + 0^2 = 4 + 0 = 4  
4^2 = 16  
1^2 + 6^2 = 1 + 36 = 37  
3^2 + 7^2 = 9 + 49 = 58  
5^2 + 8^2 = 25 + 64 = 89  
The sequence then repeats between 89 and 145 indefinitely, never reaching 1. Therefore, 25 is an unhappy number.

Code Explanation:
1. we'll start from `isHappy` Function.
2. I have used two variables `jumpOneTime` and `jumpTwoTimes` initialized with `n` and `sumOfSquares(n)` respectively.
3. If any one of this variable reaches to 1 then we will simply return true.
5. If `jumpOneTime == jumpTwoTimes` condition met means, it indicates a loop in the sequence of calculations. This loop signifies that the process will continue indefinitely without reaching the happy number condition of summing up to 1.
6. So we simply return `false`.
7. the below loop will check if there is loop or not.
   ```
   while(jumpOneTime != jumpTwoTimes)
        {
            jumpOneTime = sumOfSquares(jumpOneTime);
            jumpTwoTimes = sumOfSquares(sumOfSquares(jumpTwoTimes));
            if(jumpOneTime == 1 || jumpTwoTimes == 1) return true;
        }
   ```
