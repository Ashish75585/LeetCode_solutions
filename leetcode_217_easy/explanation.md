1. I have added the most optimal solution for checking if there is any duplicate or not in an array of integers.
2. there is an `unordered_set` named as `set` to store the count of the numbers in array `nums`
3. if the count of any number becomes greater than `1`, means there is a duplicate of that number.
4. If that happens then we will simply return `true`.
5. At the end if the `for` loops ends, means there is no duplicates. So we just simply returns the `false`.
