## Introduction

LeetCode is a platform for learning and practicing coding skills through various challenges, including algorithm and data structure problems. This repository is dedicated to solutions for LeetCode's easy-level problems. Each solution is provided in Python and includes detailed explanations to help understand the thought process behind solving the problem.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders corresponding to the problem number on LeetCode. Each folder contains the CPP file with the solution and an explanation file if necessary.

leetcode_solutions/
│
├── problem_1/
│   ├── solution.cpp
│   └── explanation.md
├── problem_2/
│   ├── solution.cpp
│   └── explanation.md
│
└── ...


## Usage

You can browse through the folders to find solutions to specific problems. Each solution is provided in a CPP file (`solution.cpp`). If there's an explanation accompanying the solution, it will be provided in a separate Markdown file (`explanation.md`) within the same folder.

To use these solutions:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Ashish75585/LeetCode_solutions.git

2. Navigate to the problem folder you're interested in.

3. Open the `solution.cpp` file to view the CPP code.

4. If available, read the `explanation.md` file for a detailed explanation of the solution.
